# **Configuration**

Both versions of Sentinel have config that is required to be done in json.

- Required Json configuration for both versions is [here](required.md)
- For SentinelAntiNuke (Full Version) there are only a few things you must manually set.
- In SentinelLite, you have to do everything in Json.

SentinelLite's configuration files are stored in the `./plugins/SentinelLite` folder.
